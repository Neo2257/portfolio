HTML

I know HTML since I was 10th grade and actually I already master it because I know multiple element tags and I know what is the best element for different section.

CSS

Just like HTML I learn CSS since I was 10th grade, CSS is quite difficult that's why I spend a year In order to master that technology. so now I feel confidence to that technology and I can make the website user-friendly and to make a good UI and UX design.

JS

JavaScript is the first programming language that I learn. JavaScript is so hard for me because I'm still beginner when I started coding that and JS has difficult syntax and logic that's why I'm struggled learning that technology but now I already know it but I still need to master it.

PS

I learn PhotoShop when I started vlogging, gaming and making a video for youtube so I use PhotoShop for thumbnail although I'm not master it but I think I still can able to make a good photos using that technology.
